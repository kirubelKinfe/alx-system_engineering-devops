## Explanations

1. **What is a server**:
   A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides services to clients over a network, hosting the web server, application server, application files, and database.

2. **Role of the domain name**:
   The domain name `foobar.com` maps to the server’s IP (`8.8.8.8`) via DNS, providing a human-readable address for the website.

3. **Type of DNS record for `www` in `www.foobar.com`**:
   The `www` is typically a CNAME record aliasing `www.foobar.com` to `foobar.com`, which resolves to the server’s IP via an A record.

4. **Role of the web server**:
   Nginx handles HTTP/HTTPS requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

5. **Role of the application server**:
   The application server executes application code (e.g., PHP) and generates dynamic content, interacting with the database and application files.

6. **Role of the database**:
   MySQL stores and manages the website’s data, providing it to the application server for dynamic content generation.

7. **How the server communicates with the user's computer**:
   The server uses HTTP/HTTPS protocols over the internet to respond to browser requests with web content.

8. **Issues with the infrastructure**:
   - **SPOF**: A single server failure makes the website unavailable.
   - **Downtime**: Maintenance or code deployment requires server restarts, causing downtime.
   - **Scalability**: Limited resources restrict handling high traffic.
