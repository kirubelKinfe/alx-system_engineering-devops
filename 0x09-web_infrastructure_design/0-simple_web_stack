# Simple Web Stack Design for www.foobar.com

This document outlines a single-server web infrastructure design for hosting a website accessible via `www.foobar.com`. The infrastructure uses a LAMP-like stack with Nginx, an application server, MySQL, and application files, configured to meet specific requirements.

## Repository Information
- **GitHub Repository**: [alx-system_engineering-devops](https://github.com/alx-system_engineering-devops)
- **Directory**: `0x09-web_infrastructure_design`
- **File**: `0-simple_web_stack`

## Requirements
- **Infrastructure Components**:
  - 1 server
  - 1 web server (Nginx)
  - 1 application server
  - 1 set of application files (codebase)
  - 1 database (MySQL)
  - 1 domain name (`foobar.com`) with a `www` record pointing to server IP `8.8.8.8`
- **Explanations Required**:
  - Definition of a server
  - Role of the domain name
  - Type of DNS record for `www` in `www.foobar.com`
  - Roles of the web server, application server, and database
  - Communication protocol between the server and the user’s computer
- **Issues to Address**:
  - Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
  - Downtime during maintenance
  - Scalability limitations with high traffic

## User Journey
1. **User Action**: A user enters `www.foobar.com` in their browser and presses Enter.
2. **DNS Resolution**:
   - The browser queries a DNS resolver to resolve `www.foobar.com`.
   - The resolver returns the IP address `8.8.8.8` via an A record.
3. **Request to Server**:
   - The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server at `8.8.8.8` on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
4. **Server Processing**:
   - Nginx receives the request.
   - Nginx forwards dynamic requests to the application server (e.g., PHP-FPM).
   - The application server processes the request using application files and queries the MySQL database for data.
   - The application server generates a response (e.g., HTML) and sends it back to Nginx.
5. **Response to User**:
   - Nginx delivers the response to the user’s browser.
   - The browser renders the webpage.

## Infrastructure Components and Roles
### Server
- **Definition**: A server is a physical or virtual machine running software to provide services over a network. Here, it hosts Nginx, the application server, MySQL, and application files.
- **Details**: Single Linux server (e.g., Ubuntu) with IP `8.8.8.8`.

### Domain Name (foobar.com)
- **Role**: A human-readable address that maps to the server’s IP (`8.8.8.8`) via DNS, enabling easy access and branding for the website.

### DNS Record for `www`
- **Type**: The `www` in `www.foobar.com` is a subdomain configured with an **A record**.
- **Example**: `www IN A 8.8.8.8`
- **Role**: Resolves `www.foobar.com` to the server’s IP address.

### Web Server (Nginx)
- **Role**:
  - Handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests.
  - Serves static content (e.g., images, CSS, JS) from application files.
  - Proxies dynamic requests to the application server.
  - Listens on ports 80 (
